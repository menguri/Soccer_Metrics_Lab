Unreleased_
============

1.3.0_ - 2022-11-11
===================

Changed
-------
- Runtime scheme validation of pandas dataframes is now disabled. This
  increases performance, but also means that the user is responsible for
  ensuring that the dataframes are valid.

Added
-----
- Implement caching for the ``PublicWyscoutLoader``. (`GH277 <https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction/issues/277>`_)
- Distinguish between left/right foot in bodyparts  (`GH220 <https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction/issues/220>`_)
- The ``WyscoutLoader`` now also supports accessing the API. It is no longer
  needed to download the JSON files first.

Fixed
-----
- Handle missing players in the public Wyscout data. (`GH276 <https://github.com/ml-kuleuven/socceraction/issues/276>`_)
- The ``bodypart_onehot`` feature generator now sets "bodypart_head/other" to True
  for "head", "other" and "head/other". (`GH275 <https://github.com/ml-kuleuven/socceraction/issues/275>`_)
- All feature generators now keep the original index of the input actions DataFrame.(`GH273 <https://github.com/ml-kuleuven/socceraction/issues/273>`_)
- Fixed a PerformanceWarning in the ``actiontype_onehot``, ``result_onehot``,
  ``actiontype_result_onehot`` and ``bodypart_onehot`` feature generators.
  The efficiency of these generators should have been improved too.
  (`GH370 <https://github.com/ml-kuleuven/socceraction/issues/370>`_)


Removed
-------
- ``ExpectedThreat.predict`` was renamed to ``ExpectedThreat.rate``.
- ``OptaLoader``, ``OptaCompetitionSchema``, ``OptaGameSchema``,
  ``OptaPlayerSchema``, ``OptaTeamSchema`` and ``OptaEventSchema`` were moved
  to ``socceraction.data.opta``.
- ``StatsBombLoader``, ``extract_player_games``,
  ``StatsBombCompetitionSchema``, ``StatsBombGameSchema``,
  ``StatsBombPlayerSchema``, ``StatsBombTeamSchema`` and ``StatsBombEventSchema`` were
  moved to ``socceraction.data.statsbomb``.
- ``WyscoutLoader``, ``PublicWyscoutLoader``, ``WyscoutCompetitionSchema``,
  ``WyscoutGameSchema``, ``WyscoutPlayerSchema``, ``WyscoutTeamSchema`` and
  ``WyscoutEventSchema`` were moved to ``socceraction.data.wyscout``.

CI
--
- Added PyUpgrade to the CI pipeline to automatically update Python syntax.
- Moved darglint to its own manual pre-commit hook.
- Reduced merge conflicts using the lockfile-only strategy for Depandabot



1.2.3_ - 2022-04-23
===================

Changed
-------
- Spaces, dashes and underscores are now allowed in Opta filenames.
- Wyscout considers a few off the ball fouls, namely "Out of play foul",
  "Protest", "Time lost foul" and "Late card foul". These are now excluded
  from the SPADL representation. (`GH240 <https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction/issues/240>`_)
- The Wyscout converter converted simulations to regular fouls. Now, we check
  if the preceding event was a take-on or a dribble. If so, we set the outcome
  to "failed" and drop the "Simulation". Otherwise, we replace the
  "simulation" with a failed take-on. (`GH240 <https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction/issues/240>`_)

Fixed
-----
- Fixed a bug where the WhoScored parser crashed when a coach received a red
  card.
- Fixed a bug where the WhoScored parser crashed on events with out-of-bounds
  coordinates.
- The "minutes_played" column in the "players" dataframe did not take red
  cards into account. This was fixed for all data providers.
- The ``ExpectedThreat.rate`` method gave incorrect results when applied on a SPADL dataframe with duplicate index. (`GH237 <https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction/issues/237>`_)



1.2.2_ - 2022-03-11
===================

Fixed
-----
- Fix the atomic version of the ``goal_from_shot`` labeling function
- Added missing opta event types 78 - 84
- Fixes conversion of owngoals in Atomic-SPADL (`GH198 <https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction/issues/198>`_)
- Fixes the result of shots when subsequent events are not registered due to replays (`GH199 <https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction/issues/199>`_)
- Handle incorrect timestamps in Stats Perform event data


Documentation
--------------
- Added instruction for downloading test data to the contributor guide. Also,
  the download script was improved.
- Fixed the description on how SPADL handles the direction of play

1.2.1_ - 2022-01-09

Fixed
-----

  ``venue`` field, respectively

Fixed
-----
- Fix a bug in the "minutes_played" field of the dataframe returned by the socceraction.data.wyscout.PublicWyscoutLoader.players method. (`GH153 <https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction/issues/153>`_)

1.1.0_ - 2021-09-17
====================

Added
-----

- Enhanced tests suite by use of ``@slow`` decorator, which is controlled via a ``--skip-slow`` command line argument.
- A `play_left_to_right()` function to `socceraction.spadl` and `socceraction.atomic.spadl` which changes the start and end location of each action such that all actions are performed as if the team plays from left to right.
- A `load_model()` function to `socceraction.xthreat` to load a precomputed xT grid

Changed
-------
- Own goals are converted to a "bad_touch" SPADL event with outcome "owngoal". Previously, the action type differed between providers. (`GH26 <https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction/issues/26>`_)
- All event data loaders are moved from `socceraction.spadl` to `socceraction.data`
- `socceraction.xthreat.ExpectedThreat.predict` is depracated and replaced by `socceraction.xthreat.ExpectedThreat.rate` to be compatible with the VAEP api
